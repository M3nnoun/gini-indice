# Gini Index and Data Concentration Analysis

This notebook explores the concept of the Gini Index and its relationship with data concentration. Inspired by the content of the video "12. L'indice de Gini et la concentration", it applies examples and techniques discussed to better understand data distribution using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for calculations and visualizations.

## Example
The notebook focuses on a specific example presented in the video, detailing its application and interpretation. Through practical examples and in-depth analyses, it demonstrates how the Gini Index can be used to evaluate inequality in various datasets and make informed decisions.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run each cell to execute the code and see the analysis results.
4. Customize the notebook as needed for your own datasets and analyses.
